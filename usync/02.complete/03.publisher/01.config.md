# uSync.Publisher Config

for uSync 9 and 10 the majority of the uSync publisher config now lives in the Database, and can be synced between your servers via the dashboard.

## AppId/AppKey

For your servers to communicate securely they will need to have a shared AppId and AppKey, these values have to be placed in the `appsettings.json` file on each server. 

:::tip
When you first open up the uSync.Publisher dashboard, uSync will prompt you to create an AppId and AppKey. you can cut and paste the JSON from that dialog box directly into your appsettings.json file.
:::

```json
{
  "uSync": {
    "Publisher": {
      "Settings": {
        "IncomingEnabled": true,
        "AppId": "****************",
        "AppKey": "****************"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
## appsettings.json config File

While most settings are now stored in the DB, there are a few settings you can control per server via the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "uSync": {
    "Publisher": {
      "Settings": {
        "IncomingEnabled": true,
        "OutgoingEnabled": true, 
        "AppId": "****************",
        "AppKey": "****************",
        "Publisher": "Realtime",
        "CleanReports": true,
        "PageSize": 50,
        "AdditionalFolders": "",
        "SystemFolders" : "",
        "SystemExclusions" : "",
        "FileReplacements" : "",
        "Include Host" : true,
        "ForstHostOption" : false,
        "UserAgentString" : "",
        "RequestHeaders" : "",
      }
    }
  }
}
```
